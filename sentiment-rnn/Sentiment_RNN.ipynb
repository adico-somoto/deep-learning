    "# Sentiment Analysis with an RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis. Using an RNN rather than a feedfoward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. Here we'll use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture for this network is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/network_diagram.png\" width=400px>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll pass in words to an embedding layer. We need an embedding layer because we have tens of thousands of words, so we'll need a more efficient representation for our input data than one-hot encoded vectors. You should have seen this before from the word2vec lesson. You can actually train up an embedding with word2vec and use it here. But it's good enough to just have an embedding layer and let the network learn the embedding table on it's own.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the embedding layer, the new representations will be passed to LSTM cells. These will add recurrent connections to the network so we can include information about the sequence of words in the data. Finally, the LSTM cells will go to a sigmoid output layer here. We're using the sigmoid because we're trying to predict if this text has positive or negative sentiment. The output layer will just be a single unit then, with a sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't care about the sigmoid outputs except for the very last one, we can ignore the rest. We'll calculate the cost from the output of the last step and the training label."
